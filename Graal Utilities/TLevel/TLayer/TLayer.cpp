// What should create a new layer??
// BOARD 0 0 64 0
// BOARD x y width layer
//
// Maybe if it reads a layer that doesnt exist create until that layer is met??
// Can we then make the other layers null or should we just write them blank
//
// Either we need to give the class a specific variable to deal with which layer it is
// or we need a way to not have any objects at those index's in the array.
